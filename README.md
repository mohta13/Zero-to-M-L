# ZeroToML: My AI Journey from Scratch

Welcome to my **open-source learning journey** from zero Python to real Machine Learning.  
I'm not an expert yet—but this repo is my proof that learning in public works. 🚀

---

### 🔍 What’s Inside

- ✅ My Python crash course notes
- 🤖 My first ML projects (linear regression, decision trees, etc.)
- 🧪 Mini hacks, broken ideas, wild experiments
- 🧰 Best free resources I found and actually used

---

### 📅 Weekly Progress
| Week | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| 1 | Learned variables, loops, functions in Python |
| 2 | Built first ML model: linear regression from scratch |
| 3 | Cloned spam detector from YT and added improvements |
| ... | ... |

---

### 📚 Tools I Use
- Python (with VS Code & Jupyter)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- GitHub Copilot (for code suggestions)
